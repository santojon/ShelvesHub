# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog, and this project follows Semantic Versioning.

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- The loader now actually loads Deck Shelves into Steam. It finds the running
  Steam interface, injects the Deck Shelves bundle, and re-injects on its own if
  Steam restarts — previously this was just a stub that did nothing.
- A new developer tool, `shelves-devtools`, to inspect, inject and debug the
  Steam interface from the terminal. It runs on Linux, macOS and Windows, and
  can talk to a Steam Deck remotely over SSH.
- A local test mode so you can see everything working without a Steam Deck:
  `scripts/local-debug.sh` / `scripts/local-debug.ps1` launch a normal browser,
  load an example Deck Shelves panel, and verify it end to end.
- Scripts to install and run the loader straight on a Steam Deck over SSH, plus
  a debugging guide (`docs/debugging.md`).
- One `pnpm` workflow for everything: a single `pnpm setup` installs the whole
  toolchain on macOS via Homebrew, and `pnpm` tasks build, run, test, debug
  locally, and deploy to a Steam Deck.
- Deck Shelves can now add its own panel with an icon to the Steam Quick Access
  Menu, the way the bundle wants — the loader injects a host runtime that
  provides this. The panel and icon work today as an on-screen overlay
  (verified locally); the deeper, native Steam-menu integration is scaffolded
  and pending validation on a real device.

- The loader now answers a host-API version handshake: the bundle can ask which
  HostApi version the loader speaks (`getHostApiVersion`) before relying on host
  features, and can report when it has finished starting up (`bundleReady`).
- Safety check: the loader refuses to inject an empty bundle, logging a clear
  message instead of silently marking a no-op as loaded.

### Changed
- The bundle and the loader now talk over HTTP, and the "is Deck Shelves
  loaded?" check reports the real status instead of a fixed answer.
- The loader now injects into Steam's main app context (`SharedJSContext`)
  instead of the Big Picture wrapper window — verified on a real Steam Deck,
  where it correctly detects the Steam UI.
